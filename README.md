# Minesweeper

This project aims to recreate the game minesweeper, but with additional features. Some features I intend to include are
a chaos setting for users, where the game play becomes increasingly unpredictable, as well as custom board shapes. The
goal of this project is for me to create a start to finish Python application with a GUI.
